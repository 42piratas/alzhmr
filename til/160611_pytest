-v: gives more verbose output, including the names of the tests being executed.
-s or -nocapture: allows output of print statements, which are normally captured and hidden while executing tests. Useful for debugging.
--nologcapture: allows output of logging information.
--rednose: an optional plugin, which can be downloaded here, but provides colored output for the tests.
--tags=TAGS: allows you to place an @TAG above a specific test to only execute those, rather than the entire test suite.
