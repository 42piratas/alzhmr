1 - Create a new Automator action of type Folder Action
2 - Choose the Volumes folder of your System as input, I think you'll have to use Go to folder and type /Volumes
3 - As first action choose Execute Applescript
4 - Use the following script and define the first two variables to match your needs:


on run {input, parameters}

    -- define the volume name and the application to start
    set triggeringVolumeName to "YOUR_VOLUME_NAME"
    set applicationToStart to application "Microsoft Word"

    -- walk through all newly mounted volumes
    repeat with aMountedVolumeAlias in input

        -- get the volume name from the given alias
        tell application "System Events" to set mountedVolumeName to name of aMountedVolumeAlias

        -- compare the volume name with the defined trigger name
        if mountedVolumeName is triggeringVolumeName then

            -- launch the target application
            launch applicationToStart

            -- all is done stop checking
            exit repeat

        end if

    end repeat
    return input
end run
